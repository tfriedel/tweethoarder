I love writing in Markdown. I use Claude Code to proofread, research, and suggest edits.

Above a sentence or section I am unsure of I add a comment: "!Claude - help me say this a different way."

Then I'll ask CC to go through and address comments. Claude is an awesome editor!

It's kinda cool how agents debug the shit they build. Particularly when what you are working on is not a web thing. https://t.co/TpgVbGSjhF

Anyone build something cool with Claude Code over the holidays? I wanna see 👀

Wow, this has been really effective for working with Claude Code too

## @omarsar0 - 2026-01-02 14:25

This worked better than I thought. 

It's a slash command in Claude Code to write detailed specs. 

The AskUserQuestion tool will drill you for even the smallest detail.

Great way to enhance vibe coding results.

Claude Code then creates a huge, detailed plan from it and https://t.co/9uxinDwRZH

Claude Code just booked me a flight to Japan.
Opened Safari. Searched Google Flights. Selected the cheapest option. Got to checkout.
I just watched. https://t.co/IsBbcuCVkn

I did it! It works! Using GLM-4.7-4bit with mlx_lm.server and opencode to fix real code locally! 🔥

Here single M3 Ultra 512GB, nex step phase will be 2 using Tensor Parallelism and then apply same changes to exo.

Prefill is slow on a single machine, but generation is good. https://t.co/93f1vgIQ0A

Piping command outputs = mind-blowing! This system mirrors that by having containers excel at one task. A red team skill hits network/app architecture &amp; threat models to attack ideas for blind spots. #Commandline #DevOps https://t.co/wLNdvyFnVC

Remember https://t.co/aiZgoswkJp, my funky browser agent? Well, decided to make it free and OSS. It did summarize YouTube videos before it was cool!

OSS will take a bit of clean-up. If you can't wait, you can already install it from here: https://t.co/QlbMRzYbyj https://t.co/3D1GmFmHFw

After stealing @droid 's structured compaction, I stole @AmpCode 's handoff. But this time as a shoddily vibed hook in 150LOC. pi's hook and custom tool support now let's me (and you) try out things without modifying pi's core quickly, including custom UI. https://t.co/a341bM5BE5

## @nummanali - 2026-01-01 15:26

Claude Code is looking INSANE for 2026:

- Agent Swarms: Exit plan mode with swarm - instructions for launching swarm teammates when ExitPlanMode is called with isSwarm set to true

- Session Search Assistant: - agent prompt for finding relevant sessions based on user queries,

Advent of Claude Day 31 - Claude Agent SDK

I saved the best for last. 

The same agent loop, tools, and context management that power Claude Code is available as an SDK.

Build agents that work like Claude Code in as little as 10 lines of code.

This is just the beginning. 🎇🥂 https://t.co/t5QbjP6y9g

It's the small things that make working with agents so great. I got sick of the ugly output from lint+typecheck+custom lint. Also I wanted it in parallel. Agent made it pretty and parallel &lt;3 https://t.co/zpZUHRuyfp

## @simonw - 2025-12-31 14:30

@mitsuhiko I really want to know what the impact of dropping word "expert" from "you are an expert coding assistant" would be

Shame I'm not patient enough to run a comprehensive eval and find out for sure!

OpenAI could release GPT-7 on the same day as Google releases Gemini 5, and I wouldn't care 1/20th as much as....

Claude Code 3.0...

Can you even imagine a 3.0 release when 2.x is this good?

And Opus 5? Shiiiiiiitttt..

To me there's only one AI company right now.
